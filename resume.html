        <ul>
            <li><a href="projects/graphicsHtmlAnimatedDraft16.html">Neural Network Teaching Tool (WIP)</a></li>
            <p>This project was an independent study with my advisor during the second semester of my junior year. It is designed to be a neural network simulation, able to be inserted into an online lecture document. While it accomplishes its most basic goal, it was my first look into html, css, and javascript which I am interested in revisiting soon. (I just wanted to put this in here to get a project folder format ready for future projects)</p>
