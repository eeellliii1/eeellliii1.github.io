            <li>Minor: Math</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>University of Puget Sound Computer Science Department tutor (2019 - current)</li>
            <p>Helped University of Puget Sound students understand concepts and homework for University level courses. These courses ranged from intro to CS classes regarding basic concepts and coding in Java to broad conceptual classes at the 300 level.</p>
            <li>Bellevue School District Summer Tech Assistant (2016 - 2019)</li>
            <p>Assisted Bellevue School District tech staff with preperation for the upcoming school year. These duties ranged from setting up personal workstations, moving/unboxing tech equipment, and imaging/updating computers en masse.</p>
        </ul>

            <li>MATH 181 Calculus/Analytic Geometry II</li>
            <p>Expanded upon calculus knowledge with ideas such as the area contained between two functions.</p>

            <li>MATH 210 Intro Math of Computer Science</li>
            <p>Learned general statistics and relational algebra logic that is used in computer science theory.</p>

            <li>MATH 280 Multivariate Calculus</li>
            <p>Took previous calculus concepts and brough them into 3d shapes and equations.</p>

            <li>MATH 290 Linear Algebra</li>
            <p>Learned how to use linear algebra to manipulate matrices and other advanced topics.</p>

            <p><b>Computer Science</b></p>
            <li>CSCI 161 Intro to Computer Science</li>
            <p>Learned basic java and object oriented programing.</p>

            <li>CSCI 240 Software Engineering (in prog)</li>

            <li>CSCI 261 Computer Science II</li>
            <p>Expanded upon java knowledge to create more complex algorithms such as sorting algorithms and tree-traversing algorithms.</p>

            <li>CSCI 281 Assembly Lang and Computer Arch</li>
            <p>Learned the low level inner workings of code. Used MIPS and C in addition to learning about basic circuitry.</p>

            <li>CSCI 291 Programming Language Paradigms</li>
            <p>Learned 3 different coding languages and their various strengths/weaknesses. These included Prolog, Haskell, and Scheme which we used in homework coding excercises as well as a Eliza chatbot for each language.</p>

            <li>CSCI 361 Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
            <p>Learned/coded advanced algorithms and data structures. These included data structures such as a red black tree and algorithms to find the shortest path between a web of points.</p>

            <li>CSCI 425 Natrual Language Processing (in prog)</li>
            <p>Learning how to use python to interpret and generate human text.</p>

            <li>CSCI 455 Principles of Database Systems (in prog)</li>
            <p>Learning how to create and manage databases using SQL. Also learning commandline operation of a webserver in a group setting.</p>

            <li>CSCI 475 Operating Systems</li>
            <p>Learned the place of the operating system in managing storage and resources, both hardware and software. Used C to carefully manage memory for assignments and explored parallel programming in both Java and C.</p>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Technical Projects</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="projects/graphicsHtmlAnimatedDraft16.html">Neural Network Teaching Tool (WIP)</a></li>
            <p>This project was an independent study with my advisor during the second semester of my junior year. It is designed to be a neural network simulation, able to be inserted into an online lecture document. While it accomplishes its most basic goal, it was my first look into html, css, and javascript which I am interested in revisiting soon. (I just wanted to put this in here to get a project folder format ready for future projects)</p>
